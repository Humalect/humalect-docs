**Humalect** provides Azure as one of the cloud provider integrations.

## What is Azure?

Azure Cloud is a comprehensive and powerful cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services, tools, and solutions for building, deploying, and managing cloud applications and infrastructure. It offers a wide range of features such as virtual machines, storage, databases, analytics, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), security, and more

## Azure Use Cases
1. Continuous Integration and Deployment: Organizations can use Azure DevOps to build and test their applications in the cloud, deploy applications to Azure, and manage their entire release pipeline. 
2. Infrastructure as Code: Azure provides a range of services and tools for managing infrastructure as code (IaC) using popular tools such as Terraform and Ansible. 
3. Application Monitoring and Analytics: Including Azure Monitor and Application Insights, these services provide deep insights into application performance and behavior, allowing organizations to identify issues and bottlenecks quickly, and optimize their applications for better performance and user experience.
