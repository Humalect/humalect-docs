title: Create an AWS EKS cluster

## Steps to create an AWS EKS Cluster
Go to the `clusters` tab from the left side navigation bar on the Humalect platform and click on `Create new cluster`.

**Step 1:** From the Cloud Integration drop-down menu, select `AWS`.

**Step 2:** Next, name your cluster in the `Cluster Name` field.

**Step 3:** Type a `Domain Name(s)`, you can add or delete domain names by clicking on the `(+)` or delete symbol respectively. These domains are the ones on which all the deployments in this cluster will be hosted.

**Step 4:** Then, select `Cluster Region`, and choose the one nearest to your geological location. For AWS, you'll get the following options to configure from.

- Mumbai
- Singapore
- N. Virginia
- Europe (Frankfurt)
- Europe (Ireland)
- Europe (London)
- Europe (Paris)
- Europe (Stockholm)

**Step 5:** Next, select `VPC`. You can create a new VPC or select one from the drop list.
 you'll see the following details here (This is to let you know the available resources from your AWS allocated Quota limit):
 *a. Used IPs
 b. Total IPs
 c. Used VPCs
 d. Total VPCs*


**Step 6:** Select `Monitoring Integrations` We provide integration with `Grafana` and `Datadog` as of now. You can also select `None`.

**Step 7:** Select the `Number of Nodes` and `Disk Size` by clicking on the (+) and/or (-) button or by manually entering a value.

**Step 8:** Select a suitable instance type for nodes of your cluster. Here is a list of currently supported instance types:
- T3a - offers balance of compute, memory, and network resources
- T3 - offers balance of compute, memory, and network resources
- T4g - Arm-based Graviton2 processors delivering better performance over T3
- M5 - latest generation of General Purpose Instances powered by Intel XeonÂ® Platinum 8175M processors
- C4 - Optimized for compute-intensive workloads
- R5 - Designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

<!---
## Select a Virtual Machine:

### 1. T3a Instances
Offer a balance of compute, memory, and network resources for a broad spectrum of general-purpose workloads including micro-services, low-latency interactive applications, small and medium databases, virtual desktops, development environments, code repositories, and business-critical applications.

### 2. T3 Instances
Offer a balance of compute, memory, and network resources and are designed for applications with moderate CPU usage that experience temporary spikes in use.

### 3. T4g Instances
Offers a balance of compute, memory, and network resources for a broad spectrum of general-purpose workloads including large-scale micro-services, small and medium databases, virtual desktops, and business-critical applications.

### 4. M5 Instances
This family provides a balance of computing, memory, and network resources, and is a good choice for many applications.

### 5. C4 Instances
Instances are optimized for compute-intensive workloads and deliver very cost-effective high performance at a low price-per-compute ratio.

### 6. R5 Instances
Memory-optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

After you select any one of the machines from the above options, click on the `create cluster` button at the bottom right to start creating your cluster.

:::note 
A cluster creation can take about 10-15 minutes, depending on the cloud provider.

## Create CDNs in AWS Cluster

Once the AWS cluster is successfully created, you'll see the details like DNS URL, VPC Name, Public and Private subnets, cluster version, etc.
