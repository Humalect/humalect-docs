# Pipeline Deletion Process

### Prerequisites for Updating a Pipeline

Before proceeding with the process of updating a pipeline using the Humalect Console, ensure that you satisfy the following prerequisites:

1. **Availability of a Running Cluster:**
   You must have a functional and active cluster established within the Humalect system.

2. **Existing Pipeline Creation:**
   The pipeline you intend to update should have been previously created and exist within the Humalect environment.

### Implications of Deleting a Pipeline

When you delete a pipeline within the Humalect platform, the following consequences will occur:

1. **Sub-domain Deactivation:**
   The sub-domain associated with the deployed pipeline will cease to function.

2. **Deletion of Associated Kubernetes Objects:**
   All Kubernetes objects linked to the pipeline, such as `ingress`, `deployments`, `secrets`, and `services`, will be permanently deleted.

### Precautions before Deleting a Pipeline

Before initiating the deletion of a pipeline, it is advisable to create backups of the following components:

- `YAML` Configuration Files
- `Dockerfile`
- Secrets

In case you do not have the option to delete visible, it indicates that your role-based access control (RBAC) permissions are insufficient to perform the deletion. Contact your organization's administrator to grant you the necessary permissions.
