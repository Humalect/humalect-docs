# What is Humalect and why built it?

We are a team of passionate DevOps and full stack engineers who faced multiple issues while working because of the way developer teams function.

We started speaking to other engineers and everyone could relate to the struggle. Thus, in 2021, Humalect was born.

## **Problems we saw:**

1. DevOps is iterative, takes months to set up (read 2-12, trust me) and need specialised engineers. This is true for small teams (say upto 30 engineers)
2. With availability of multiple cloud providers and cloud native solutions, everyone is building their similar solutions in-house to solve the same problem differently.
3. Days and months spent setting up and maintaining open-source software and versioning.
4. As dev teams grow, things like CI/CD and containers become the only solution for scalability and productivity but take a lot of time to setup.
5. People are already locked into various DevOps solutions and fear heavy migration debt to onboard to k8s
6. Things like security and scalability come to mind only reactively when issues happen and remain the burning priority for next few months (human mind worries a lot, it sucks)
7. Trying out and buying various tools for utilities like observability, Ci/CD, incident management etc. takes months and come with maintenance commitment (even more if you plan on hosting your own opensource solution)
8. Finding a genie is easier than finding rockstar Devops engineers

Now specifically for larger teams, say more than 100 engineers:
1. They started with architecture patterns and infra solutions few years back and now need to migrate to the latest stack, say k8s for scalability, automation, cost optimization and easier maintenance.
2. Most of these teams do not have the internal competency to do it, they will have to hire for these competencies and even after that it will take 0.5-3 years to migrate it all (numbers based on conversations with few indian unicorns)
3. They may not necessarily know what are the best infra choices for them and might spend a lot of time doing smaller POCs to make those decisions.

**This leads to**

1. Productivity problems from the team’s perspective.
2. Compromised customer experience.
3. Security issues.
4. App downtime.
5. Blown up cloud costs.
6. Heavy maintenance and tech debt and poor engineering practices

**The proposed solution – Humalect**

From day one, we give you the best possible solutions for the most common DevOps scenarios. Starting from your infrastructure to how your application gets deployed to monitoring it and letting you know if something goes down.

All of this is secure and scalable + We deliver this in less than a day in most cases.

All you need to do is to bring your code repositories and your cloud account. Everything stays in your cloud; we don’t lock you in.

**The deliverables**

1. K8s clusters and stable environments created in your cloud account via auto generated IaC templates using best cloud and security practices
2. CI/CD enabled deployments directly from your repositories in a click
3. Built in observability to help you bebug easily and keep track of resource usage
4. We will behave like your extended team and help you onboard/migrate to the humalect platform and provide whatever support you need
5. Auto scalability of infrastructure and your application guarenteed from day 1
6. full support for creation of terraform, Dockerfile and YAML templates.
7. inbuilt logging and metrics for quick debugging, integrations with other tools if you want deep insights
8. Help in saving upto 57% on your AWS EC2 workloads via reserved instances through our partner network

**Who is it for**

1. Small teams (upto 30-50 engineers):
- your dev teams are spending a lot of time managing cloud/infrastruture
- you have delayed sprints due to infra/env instability
- you have to go live by a deadline or you have customers waiting but you don't seem to have a go live plan infra wise
- you cannot find a good DevOps engineer to do it all for you
- You need a saviour to take you out of your misery

2. Large teams (>100 engineers)
- You have a lot of tech debt/lock in due to your past stack/infra/cloud choices and now you are looking to move to latest technologies available
- You recognise that change is needed
- your team needs to upskill for the needed migration, that is going to take easily 6 months or you need to hire new engineers or take outside help
- It will take you atleast 6 months if you build the solution inhouse and post that the onus of maintenance relies on you
- You know the productivity can be better or there can be cost savings if you need to newer approaches but you don't seem to figure out an execution plan.

**Benefits we promise**
- Better visibility into infra and deployment lifecycles
- faster release cycles, thanks to time saved on broken environments/infra management
- better cost control due to auto scalability and better cloud costs through our partner network
- better collaboration among your team as siloing goes away
- better developer productivity
- scalable infrastructure and full visibility via integrations
